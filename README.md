Uses javascript and node.js and next.js as the backend framework along with firebase for the database to store user data like username, passwords 
and post data.


Users get a feed of most recent posts presented one post at a time.

Users can log in with their google account and have to make a custom username.

Users can make new posts written using the markdown format.

Users can also edit their own previously created posts.



TO-DO:


Users will have the option to upload an image but that function doesn't work right now.

Users will also get the option to heart or unheart posts but that's also something that isn't working right now.
